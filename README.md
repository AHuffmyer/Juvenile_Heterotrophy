**Abstract:**

Coral reef ecosystem recovery relies on successful recruitment and survival of scleractinian corals following high-mortality disturbances, such as bleaching events. Juvenile corals face critical survival bottlenecks, intensified by existing environmental stressors, that determine post-settlement success (i.e., survivorship and growth). Early and rapid investments in growth provide an advantage to recruits in escaping size-dependent mortality, which may be facilitated by energy surpluses supplied through heterotrophic feeding on planktonic prey. We investigated the potential for heterotrophic feeding to increase the survival and growth of juvenile corals and used laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) to measure changes in their physiological condition by tracking tissue thickness and symbiont population fluorescence. Pocillopora acuta larvae were settled in flow-through filtered seawater (1 m) and exposed to the presence or absence of natural plankton (63-243 m) in two temperature regimes (25.8°C, 27.3°C), with settled colonies reared in thermal and nutritional treatments for one month. Heterotrophic feeding had a positive influence on growth rates, but not survival, of juvenile P. acuta corals in this study. In addition to greater rates of skeletal growth, juvenile corals with access to prey had thicker tissues and higher Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence, providing greater potential for energy acquisition and storage. In response to higher respiratory demand in warmer temperatures, juveniles without access to heterotrophy had thinner tissues and lower Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence, indicating heterotrophy may be particularly important in promoting growth in elevated temperature. The capacity for early post-settlement recruits to exploit increased food availability is a key energetic strategy to support tissue and skeletal growth during critical lifecycle bottlenecks. These findings demonstrate the influence of heterotrophy for juvenile coral growth and provide a potential strategy for implementation in nursery efforts to propagate juvenile coral stocks. 

**Data Files:**  

*ConditioningTemps.csv* - Temperature data recorded by Apex Neptune system every 15 minutes during experimental period.  

*Settlement.csv* - Settlement of larvae in cool and ambient temperature treatments on each plug "Plug.ID". Cohort indicates day of larval release from parent colony. Larvae indicates total larvae at the start of the settlement trial. Success = number of settlers. Failures = number of swimming or dead larvae.  

*Survivorship.csv* - Survival measurements at each date on each PlugID during the study. Survivorship of 1 indicates at least one living juvenile was recorded on the plug. Censor is used in Cox PH model with a value of 0 indicating at least one living juvenile recorded on the plug and a value of 1 indicating complete mortality. Time indicates ordered timepoint and days indicates day post-settlement.  

*Growth.csv* - Total planar surface area of each juvenile, denoted by "Plug.ID" and "Colony.ID", measured over the course of the study ("StartDate" - "EndDate"). "Fused.Initial" and "Fused.Final" indicates whether juvenile was fused with others during the course of the study. Growth is recorded as "Area" and "Polyps" were area is planar surface area measured by ImageJ. Days indicates the time between start and end measurements.  

*Area.csv* - Total planar surface area of juveniles sampled for LSCM measurement of tissue thickness and Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence. Juvenile indicated by "Sample". 

*Fluorescence.csv* - Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence of each juvenile sample by LSCM. Value used for calculation of symbiont fluorescence is "Symbiont.Intensity" taken at multiple locations on each juvenile. 

*Thickness.csv* - Tissue thickness measurements of each juvenile sample by LSCM. Value used for calculation of tissue thickness is "Thickness" taken at multiple locations on each juvenile.
